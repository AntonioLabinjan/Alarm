# Alarm
Web-alarm clock. The deleting is a bit buggy, but I have no idea how to repair it...
It always deletes the alarm above the one you want to delete, no matter which alarm you try to delete...if you have 10 alarms, it will delete 5 of them on first try
...but really, who needs more than 1 alarm :)
